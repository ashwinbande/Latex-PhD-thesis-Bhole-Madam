\subsubsection{Chapter 1} Introduction - This chapter addresses the aspects containing introductory part. The necessity and the objectives of this research work are clearly mentioned. The overall theme of the complete research work is presented.
\subsubsection{Chapter 2} Literature Survey - A summary of the exhaustive literature survey is represented. An overview of arc modeling, Transient Recovery Voltage, Dynamic Contact Resistance Measurement (DCRM), Standards related to circuit breaker timings are discussed in detail.
\subsubsection{Chapter 3} System Development - Computational model of IEEE network for TRV study under different fault conditions is developed in EMTP-RV. Similarly analytical and mathematical models are developed. Dynamic contact resistance measurement is explained. Mathematical treatment is explained in detail with relevant references.
\subsubsection{Chapter 4} Performance Analysis â€“ Results of analytical and computational methods are presented. Justification for difference is given. Measured and collected data of DCRM from field is analyzed in detail using HISAC ULTIMA test manager software and new algorithm is proposed to detect the contact anomaly. Computer program in Java is developed to determine the health of circuit breaker.
\subsubsection{Chapter 5} Conclusions - In this chapter conclusions of the research work, future work and  applications are presented.
